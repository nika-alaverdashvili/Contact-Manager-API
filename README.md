# Flask Contact-Manager-API

This Flask Contact-Manager-API is a project that implements a Flask API for managing a contact list. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on contacts, such as adding new contacts, retrieving contacts based on specific criteria, updating existing contacts, and deleting contacts.

## Features

- Create new contacts: Users can add new contacts to the contact list by providing information such as username, name, lastname, phone number, email, and address.

- Retrieve contacts: Users can retrieve contacts from the contact list based on query parameters such as username, name, lastname, phone, email, and address.

- Update contacts: Users can update the information of existing contacts by providing the contact ID and the updated data.

- Delete contacts: Users can delete contacts from the contact list by providing the contact ID.

The API follows RESTful architecture principles and provides endpoints for different operations. The responses are returned in JSON format.

Please note that this API is deployed for demonstration purposes only and does not include authentication or authorization mechanisms.
